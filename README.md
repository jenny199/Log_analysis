# MoodleDatabase-EducationalDataLogAnalysis
Analysing the 2019 10 Academy learners activity in the Moodle Learning Management System. The moodle LMS is a highly scalable framework, and all students activities are stored in a highly structured database.

In 2019, 10 Academy used the Moodle LMS to manage about 1000 students in their 6 months data science training. Learners, course instructors, and all admins interacted with the Moodle system for almost all the training activities. All events from these activities are logged in the moodle postgres database.

10 Academy, like any other educational facility:

    . is interested to understand the learners skill and knowledge development, and

    . is interested to build models that are able to predict possible dropouts as well as classify learners into doing, well, doing ok, and struggling groups.

    . 10 Academy is also interested in automating the process of reminding learners approaching deadlines, providing quick feedback based on their overall community engagement and performance.

    . Moreover, given the main goal of 10 Academy training is to make students job ready, it wants to measure students' performance across many relevant metrics.
